# Face and Eye Detection using OpenCV
This project demonstrates a real-time face and eye detection system using OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifiers. The system captures live video from a webcam, processes each frame to detect faces and eyes, and visually marks the detected features.
### Features 
- Initialization:
  - The Haar Cascade classifiers for face and eye detection are loaded using cv2.CascadeClassifier.
